# cs598-dl4h-project

This project is a reproduction of [StageNet](https://github.com/v1xerunt/StageNet), and the data preprocessing stage applies the [MIMIC-III Benchmarks](https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks/) workflow.

The model.py and train.py files are modified versions of StageNet files used for abalation test, as well as hidden_dim and chunk_size test.
